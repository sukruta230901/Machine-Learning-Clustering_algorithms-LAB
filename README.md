This repo contains Lab practices of Machine Learning performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python language

ðŸš€ LAB-7: K-Means Clustering

â—¾ LAB 7 ipynb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the K-Means Clustering on a given data set and visualize the results. This code files uses the Mall_Customers.csv dataset file to perform the K-Means Clustering and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

ðŸš€ LAB-8: Hierarchical Clustering

â—¾ LAB 8 ipynb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the Hierarchical Clustering on a given data set and visualize the results. This code files uses the Mall_Customers.csv dataset file to perform the Hierarchical Clustering and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
